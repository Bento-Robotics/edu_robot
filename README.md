# edu_robot

Welcome to the EduArt ROS2 robot control software. In first place it provides a ROS2 node for controlling and monitoring the EduArt robots, most likely the robot Eduard in different hardware realizations like the IoT Bot or IPC Bot. There is also a [digital twin](https://github.com/EduArt-Robotik/edu_simulation) in the making, which is not yet feature complete but already the basic interface implements.

This packages also designed to used in a robot fleet setup. Basically it is able to handle multiple robot instances at the same time using namespaces.

# EduArt's Robot ROS Interfaces

A basic interface to the EduArt robots was defined. This interfaces are valid for all our robots. Following inputs are required for an operating robot:

# Controlling the Robot

A controller can be requested to connect by pressing a specific button once. For the recommended controllers, it is the symbol between the axes.
To operate the Robot, the following buttons and axes of the controller are assigned as follows:


| Axis  | DS5                       | Idle position | Value range | function          | 
|-------|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|

# Setting up your Joystick;

A joystick can be used to operate Eduard. For this purpose, the robot must be extended by a Debian-compatible Bluetooth stick. PlayStation&reg; 4 and PlayStation&reg; 5 controllers were used, which are interpreted identically in their operating interface. The initial start-up of a Bluetooth controller follows.

Start the Bluetooth controller in the operating system:

```console
$ bluetoothctl
```

Set up the controller and prepare for scanning:

```console
$ agent on 
$ default-agent 
$ power on 
$ discoverable on 
$ pairable on
```

Put the PlayStation&reg; Controller into connection mode by pressing the Share and PS buttons simultaneously. 
Rapid flashing indicates the status.

<img src="documentation/images/controller_pairing.jpg" width="500" /> <br>

Now start the scanning process:

```console
$ scan on
```

The connection process so far should look like this. Your joystick is now recognised as a wireless controller. Copy the MAC address of the device for the rest of the procedure.

```console
root@iot2050-debian:~# bluetoothctl
Agent registered
[bluetooth] # agent on
Agent is already registered
[bluetooth] # power on
Changing the power on succeeded
[bluetooth] # discoverable on
Changing discoverable on succeeded
[CHG] Controller XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Discoverable: yes
[bluetooth] # pairable on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Discovering:yes
[NEW] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Wireless Controller
[bluetooth] # 
```

Connect the controller using the following commands and its MAC address. If needed, press the PlayStation button again when the light signals stop flashing.

```console
$ pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX 
$ trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX 
$ connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
$ exit 
```

NOTE: These steps are only required once at the very beginning. From now on, when the PS button is pressed, the joystick should automatically connect to the IOT2050 once it has successfully booted up. These operations are only then necessary again if the controller has been connected to another device in the meantime.

# Deploying

A Docker container is used to run this software on our robots. Normally, all our robots are shipped with a Docker container registered to start after a reboot. If you want to deploy a newer version, or whatever the reason, make sure to remove the previously deployed container. To check which containers are running, use the following command:

```bash
docker container ls 
```
A typically print out looks like:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED      STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
46c8590424c0   eduard-iotbot:0.1.1-beta   "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   6 days ago   Up 21 minutes             eduard-iotbot-0.1.1-beta
```

To stop and remove the container, use the following command with the container ID displayed by the above command:

```bash
docker stop <container id>
docker rm <container id>
```

## Deploying on IoT2050

This section describes how the software is deployed on an IoT2050 in a Docker environment. First clone the repository on the robot by executing this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduArt-Robotik/edu_robot.git
```

Then navigate into the docker folder in the cloned repository:

```bash
cd edu_robot/docker/iot2050
```

Using make the Docker image can be build:

```bash
make all
make clean
```

Note: this could take some while, ~15min.

After executing these command a new Docker image with the name "eduard-iotbot:0.1.1-beta" should be created. It can be checked by following command:

```bash
docker image ls
```

The docker container can easily started by the command:

```bash
docker run --user user --name eduard-iotbot-0.2.0 --restart=always --privileged -v /dev:/dev --net=host --pid=host --ipc=host --group-add dialout --env EDU_ROBOT_NAMESPACE=eduard/red eduard-iotbot:0.2.0
```

With the flag "--restart=always" the container will come up after rebooting the system. If this is not wanted please remove this flag. The flag "-env EDU_ROBOT_NAMESPACE=" defines the used namespace by this robot. In this example "eduard/red" was used. Please update the namespace according your robot color.

## Deploying on IPC127e

This section describes how the software is deployed on an IPC127e in a Docker environment. First clone the repository on the robot by executing this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduArt-Robotik/edu_robot.git
```

Then navigate into the docker folder in the cloned repository:

```bash
cd edu_robot/docker/ipc127e
```

Using make the Docker image can be build:

```bash
make all
make clean
```

Note: this could take some while, ~8min.

After executing these command a new Docker image with the name "eduard-ipc127e:0.1.1-beta" should be created. It can be checked by following command:

```bash
docker image ls
```

The docker container can easily started by the command:

```bash
docker run --name eduard-ipc127e-0.2.0 --env EDU_ROBOT_NAMESPACE=eduard/red --restart=always --privileged -v /dev:/dev --network host --pid=host --ipc=host eduard-ipc127e:0.2.0
```

With the flag "--restart=always" the container will come up after rebooting the system. If this is not wanted please remove this flag.

# Monitoring Eduard using RViz

For visualization of Eduard's sensors and actors a RViz setup is provided including a robot description. Since Eduard ROS control node publish all of Eduard's states via TF and ROS topic/services it is easy to access them.

The best way to monitor Eduard's states is using RViz. In the package "edu_robot_control" a launch file is provided including a RViz configuration that allows an easy and fast start. Two ways are supported.

## Native ROS2 Installation

If ROS is natively installed the "edu_robot_control" package can be installed into an ROS workspace. As first step clone the package into the workspace by:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduArt-Robotik/edu_robot_control.git
```

Please make sure the package will be cloned into the "src" folder in the workspace. If no knowledge about ROS is present please see [docs.ros.org](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html) for further information. 

After the package was cloned it needs to be installed via:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select edu_robot_control
```

Now RViz with the correct configuration can be launched by:

```bash
ros2 launch edu_robot_control eduard-monitor.launch.py
```

If RViz comes up properly it will be shown following:

![Eduard visualized using RViz](documentation/image/eduard-monitoring-using-rviz.png)

## Installed into a Docker Container

Another way is to build a Docker image using the provided docker file. First navigate into the correct folder:

```bash
cd edu_robot/docker/host
```

Next step is to build the Docker image by executing following command:

```bash
make all
make clean
```

After the Docker image was built it can be started using following command:

```bash
docker run --rm --user=user --net=host --pid=host --env=DISPLAY --volume=/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw eduard-robot-monitoring:alpha
```
